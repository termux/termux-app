How to install Termux app from F-Droid:

1.  Open F-Droid on your Android or Chrome OS device by tapping [this
    link](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/),
2.  Tap Download APK,
3.  Tap the downloaded APK on your device,
4.  Tap allow installation of apps from unknown sources (you will want
    to set this option anyway to be able to install [apps built on your
    device](Working_with_APKs) in Termux),
5.  Allow the installation to complete,
6.  Once installed, you will see the Termux launcher on your home screen
    and in your App Drawer. Tap the icon to fire up the application.

Please do not mix your installation of Termux between Google Play and
F-Droid. There are compatibility issues such as, "[Can't install
Termux:Api from google play on Nougat
\#53](https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/53)".
