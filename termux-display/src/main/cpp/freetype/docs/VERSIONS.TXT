Due to  our use of  `libtool' to generate  and install the  FreeType 2
libraries on Unix  systems, as well as other historical  events, it is
generally very difficult  to know precisely which release  of the font
engine is installed on a given system.

This file tries to explain why and to document ways to properly detect
FreeType on Unix.


1. Version and Release numbers
------------------------------

For each new public release of FreeType 2, there are generally *three*
distinct `version' numbers to consider:

  * The official FreeType 2 release number, like 2.7.0 or 2.10.2.

  * The  libtool (and  Unix)  specific version  number, like  23.2.17.
    This is what

      pkg-config freetype2 --modversion

    or

      freetype-config --version

    returns.

  * The platform-specific shared object  number, used for example when
    the library is installed as `/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.17.2'.

The platform-specific number is, unsurprisingly, platform-specific and
varies with  the operating system  you are using (several  variants of
Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, etc.).  You  should thus _never_ use it, even
for simple tests.

The libtool-specific number  does not equal the release  number but is
tied to it.

The  release  number  is  available  at  *compile*  time  through  the
following macros defined in `freetype.h':

  - FREETYPE_MAJOR: major release number
  - FREETYPE_MINOR: minor release number
  - FREETYPE_PATCH: patch release number

See below for a small autoconf fragment.

The  release  number  is  also  available  at  *runtime*  through  the
`FT_Library_Version' API.


2. History
----------

The  following  table  gives,  for   all  releases  since  2.5.0,  the
corresponding  libtool number,  as well  as the  shared object  number
found on _most_ systems, but not all of them:


    release     libtool     so

3. Autoconf Code Fragment
-------------------------

Lars  Clausen contributed  the  following autoconf  fragment to  check
which version of FreeType is installed on a system (now updated to use
`pkg-config'  instead of  `freetype-config').   This one  tests for  a
version that is at least 2.10.2; you should change it to check against
other release numbers.


  AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether FreeType version is 2.10.2 or higher])
  old_CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"
  CPPFLAGS=`pkg-config freetype2 --cflags`
  AC_TRY_CPP([

#include <ft2build.h>
#include <freetype/freetype.h>

#if FREETYPE_MAJOR*10000 + FREETYPE_MINOR*100 + FREETYPE_PATCH < 21002
#  error FreeType version too low.
#endif

  ],
  [AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
   FREETYPE_LIBS=`pkg-config freetype2 --libs`
   AC_SUBST(FREETYPE_LIBS)
   AC_DEFINE(HAVE_FREETYPE,1,[Define if you have the FreeType2 library])
   CPPFLAGS="$old_CPPFLAGS"],
  [AC_MSG_ERROR([Need FreeType library version 2.10.2 or higher])])
