Here is a list of items that need to be addressed in FreeType 2
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement stem3/counter hints properly in the Postscript hinter.

* Add CIDCMap support to the CID driver.

* Add track kerning support to the PFR driver.

* Add kerning (AFM file) support to the CID driver.


Here is a list of bugs which should be handled
----------------------------------------------

Other bugs have been registered at the savannah bugzilla of FreeType.

* CID driver:
    Handle the case where a CID font has a top-level font matrix also
    (see PLRM, 5.11.3, Type 0 CIDFonts).  Since CID_FaceInfoRec lacks
    a font_matrix entry we have to directly apply it to all subfont
    matrices.

* CID driver:
    Use top-level font matrix entry for setting the upem value, not the
    entries in the FDarray.  If absent, use 1000.
