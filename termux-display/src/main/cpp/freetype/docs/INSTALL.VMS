How to build the FreeType 2 library on VMS
-----------------------------------------

It is actually very straightforward to install the FreeType 2 library.
Just  execute vms_make.com from  the toplevel  directory to  build the
library.  This procedure currently accepts the following options:

DEBUG
  Build the library with debug information and without optimization.

lopts=<value>
  Options to pass to the link command e.g. lopts=/traceback

ccopt=<value>
  Options to pass to the C compiler e.g. ccopt=/float=ieee

In case you did download the demos, place them in a separate directory
sharing the same top level  as the directory of FreeType 2  and follow
the same instructions as above for  the demos from  there.  The  build
process relies on this  to figure out  the location  of the FreeType 2
include files.


To rebuild  the  sources it is necessary to  have MMS/MMK installed on
the system.

The library is available in the directory

  [.LIB]

To  compile applications  using  FreeType  2 you  have  to define  the
logical FREETYPE pointing to the directory

  [.INCLUDE.FREETYPE]

i.e., if  the directory in which  this INSTALL.VMS file  is located is
$disk:[freetype] then define the logical with

  define freetype $disk:[freetype.include.freetype]

This version has  been tested with Compaq C  V6.2-006 on OpenVMS Alpha
V7.2-1.
