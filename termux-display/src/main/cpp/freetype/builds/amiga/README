The makefile.os4 is for the AmigaOS4 SDK.  To use it, type
"make -f makefile.os4", it produces a link library libft2_ppc.a.

The makefile is for ppc-morphos-gcc-2.95.3-bin.tgz (gcc 2.95.3 hosted on
68k-Amiga producing MorphOS-PPC-binaries from http://www.morphos.de).
To use it, type "make assign", then "make"; it produces a link library
libft2_ppc.a.

The smakefile is a makefile for Amiga SAS/C 6.58 (no longer available,
latest sold version was 6.50, updates can be found in Aminet).  It is
based on the version found in the sourcecode of ttf.library 0.83b for
FreeType 1.3.1 from Richard Griffith (ragriffi@sprynet.com,
http://ragriffi.home.sprynet.com).

You will also need the latest include files and amiga.lib from the
Amiga web site (https://os.amigaworld.de/download.php?id=3) for
AmigaOS 3.9; the generated code should work under AmigaOS 2.04 and up.

To use it, call "smake assign" and then "smake" from the builds/amiga
directory.  The results are:

- A link library "ft2_680x0.lib" (where x depends on the setting of
  the CPU entry in the smakefile) containing all FreeType2 parts
  except of the init code, debugging code, and the system interface
  code.

- ftsystem.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  system interface code which uses fopen() fclose() fread() fseek()
  ftell() malloc() realloc() and free() from lib:sc.lib (not pure).

- ftsystempure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  system interface code which uses Open() Close() Read() Seek()
  ExamineFH() AsmAllocPooled() AsmFreePooled() etc.  This version can
  be used in both normal programs and in Amiga run-time shared system
  librarys (can be linked with lib:libinit.o, no copying of DATA and
  BSS hunks for each OpenLibrary() necessary).  Source code is in
  src/base/ftsystem.c.

- ftdebug.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  debugging code which uses vprintf() and exit() (not pure).
  Debugging can be turned on in FT:include/freetype/config/ftoption.h
  and with FT_SetTraceLevel().

- ftdebugpure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  debugging code which uses KVPrintf() from lib:debug.lib and no
  exit().  For debugging of Amiga run-time shared system libraries.
  Source code is in src/base/ftdebug.c.

- NO ftinit.o.  Because linking with a link library should result in
  linking only the needed object modules in it, but standard
  ftsystem.o would force ALL FreeType2 modules to be linked to your
  program, I decided to use a different scheme: You must #include
  FT:src/base/ftinit.c in your sourcecode and specify with #define
  statements which modules you need.  See
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h.


To use in your own programs:

- Insert the #define and #include statements from top of
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h in your source code and
  uncomment the #define statements for the FreeType2 modules you need.

- You can use either PARAMETERS=REGISTER or PARAMETERS=STACK for
  calling the FreeType2 functions, because the link library and the
  object files are compiled with PARAMETERS=BOTH.

- "smake assign" (assign "FT:" to the FreeType2 main directory).

- Compile your program.

- Link with either ftsystem.o or ftsystempure.o, if debugging enabled
  with either ftdebug.o or (ftdebugpure.o and lib:debug.lib), and with
  ft2_680x0.lib as link library.


To adapt to other compilers:

- The standard ANSI C maximum length of 31 significant characters in
  identifiers is not enough for FreeType2.  Check if your compiler has
  a minimum length of 40 significant characters or can be switched to
  it.  "idlen=40" is the option for SAS/C.  Setting #define
  HAVE_LIMIT_ON_IDENTS in an include file may also work (not tested).

- Make sure that the include directory in builds/amiga is searched
  before the normal FreeType2 include directory, so you are able to
  replace problematic include files with your own version (same may be
  useful for the src directory).

- An example of how to replace/workaround a problematic include file
  is include/freetype/config/ftconfig.h; it changes a #define that
  would prevent SAS/C from generating XDEF's where it should do that and
  then includes the standard FreeType2 include file.
