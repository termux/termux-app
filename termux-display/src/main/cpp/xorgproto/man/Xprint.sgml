  <refsynopsisdiv>
    <para>Xprint is a very flexible, extensible, scalable, client/server
     print system based on ISO 10175 (and some other specs) and the X11
     rendering protocol.
     Using Xprint an application can search, query and use devices like
     printers, FAX machines or create documents in formats like PDF.
     In particular, an application can seek a printer, query supported
     attributes (like paper size, trays, fonts etc.), configure the printer
     device to match it&rsquo;s needs and print on it like on any other X device
     reusing parts of the code which is used for the video card Xserver.

    <title>OVERVIEW</title>
    <para>
      The "X Print Service" technology allows X rendering to devices such as
      printers and fax.  Most of the service is available in the X11
      technology stack as Xp, with the remainder in single toolkit stacks (e.g. DtPrint for CDE).
      Modifications have also been made to the LessTif/Motif/Qt technology
      stacks to support Xprint.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Xp portion consists of:

    <para>
      From an X clients perspective, it can attach to one of two nearly
      identical X-Servers, a "Video" X-Server, and a "Print" X-Server
      which has the additional Xp capability but otherwise looks and
      behaves the same.

    <title>HOW THE X PRINT SERVICE WORKS</title>
    <para>
      The X Print Service expands on the traditional X-Server and Xlib world
      in four ways.

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Most obvious is the use of "print ddx drivers" instead of
            "video ddx drivers".  While a video ddx driver modifies pixels
            in a video frame buffer, a print ddx driver generates "page
            description language (PDL)" output (such as PCL, PDF or PostScript)
            or sends the print rendering instructions to a platform-specific
            print API (like Win32/GDI).
          </para>
          <para>
            Once a print ddx driver generates PDL output, it can be sent to
            a spooler such as <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
            or retrieved by the client (to implement functionality like "print-to-file").
          </para>
          <para>
            Though not currently done, a single X-Server can support both
            print and video ddx drivers.
            <!-- FIXME: IBM/AIX people have integrated Xprt into their main Xserver (currently experimental) ... -->
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Since printers support "paged" output, unlike video, a portion
            of the Xp Extension supports APIs to delineate printed output.
            For example, <function>XpStartPage</function> and <function>XpEndPage</function> tell the X-Server where
            a physical page starts and ends in an otherwise continuous
            stream of X rendering primitives.  Likewise, <function>XpStartJob</function> and
            <function>XpEndJob</function> determine when a collection of pages starts and ends.
            <function>XpEndJob</function> typically causes the generated PDL to be submitted to
            a spooler, such as <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Since printers have extensive capabilities, another portion of
            the Xp Extension supports APIs to manipulate "print contexts".
          </para>
          <para>
            Once a printer is selected using the Xp Extension API, a print
            context to represent it can be created.  A print context
            embodies the printer selected - it contains the printer's
            default capabilities, selectable range of capabilities,
            printer state, and generated output.  Some "attributes" within
            the print context can be modified by the user, and the
            X-Server and print ddx driver will react accordingly.  For
            example, the attribute "content-orientation" can be set to
            "landscape" or "portrait" (if the printer supports these
            values - which can be queried using the Xprint API as well).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Since printers can have "built in" fonts, the Xp Extension in
            the X-Server works with the print ddx drivers to make
            available (for printing only) additional fonts on a per print
            context basis.
          </para>
          <para>
            When a print context is created and set for a given printer,
            the X font calls may be able to access additional printer
            fonts.  To do this (typically), the X-Server must have access
            to "printer metric files" (.pmf) that describe at minimum the
            metrics of the built in fonts.

    <title>USAGE</title>

      There are three tasks to start the X Print Service:

      The tasks are described in detail below.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>SERVER CONFIGURATION</title>
    <para>
      The X Print Server (Xprt) can read a number of configuration files which
      control its behavior and support for printers.  Each vendor platform has
      a default location for this information.  Xprt can also read the
      environment variable <envar>XPCONFIGDIR</envar> to locate alternate configuration
      directories.  Common settings include:

      <simplelist type="vert">
        <member>export XPCONFIGDIR=/X11/lib/X11/XpConfig/</member>
        <member>export XPCONFIGDIR=/proj/x11/xc/programs/Xserver/XpConfig/</member>
      </simplelist>
    </para>
    <para>
      Xprt has many built-in defaults, and lacking any configuration files,
      will immediately try to support all printers visible via <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lpstat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order of importance for configuration by a system administrator, the
      configuration files for a "C" locale are as follows (see <citerefentry><refentrytitle>Xprt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>__appmansuffix__</manvolnum></citerefentry> for more
      details (including support for non-"C" locales)):
      <variablelist>

          <term><filename>${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/Xprinters</filename></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              'Xprinters' is the top most configuration file.  It tells
              Xprt which specific printer names (e.g.  mylaser) should
              be supported, and whether <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lpstat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> or other commands
              should be used to automatically supplement the list of
              printers.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The 'printer' file maps printer names to model
              configurations (see 'model-config' below).  For example,
              "mylaser" could be mapped to a "HPDJ1600C", and all other
              arbitrary printers could be mapped to a default, such as
              "HPLJ4SI".  When depending on <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lpstat</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> in the Xprinters
              file, setting up defaults in 'printer' becomes all the
              more important.

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The 'document' file specifies the initial document values
              for any print jobs.  For example, which paper tray to
              use, what default resolution, etc.

            <para>
              The 'job' file specifies the initial job values for any
              print jobs.  For example, "notification-profile" can be
              set so that when a print job is successfully sent to a
              printer, e-mail is sent to the user.

              The 'model-config' file has attributes that describe the

              Printer model fonts may also be present.  The model-config
              file also identifies the print ddx driver to be used.

              For each printer model supported, a complete hierarchy of
              files should exist.  In most cases, these files do not
              need to be modified.

            <para>
              The print ddx drivers can have highly specific
              configuration files to control their behavior.  In most

          <para>
            Choose an execution model for the X Print Service.  The X
            Print Service can be run on a per-user session basis, per
            machine basis, or can be run on a few machines globally
            available to a number of users.

          <para>
            If print jobs are to be submitted to a spooler (almost always

            spooler subsystem (most often <citerefentry><refentrytitle>lp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>)
            on the same machine running the X Print Service.

            (such as CDEnext's "dtpdmd") at the appropriate times.
            Note that libXprintUtils-based applications/toolkits do not need
            a Print Dialog Manager Daemon process to use Xprint.

      The details are described below.

      Because the X Print Service is based on X, it can be easily distributed.
      The most significant factors in which execution model to choose will be
      driven by:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            how many printers will be accessible through the printer
            subsystem on any given machine.  A system administrator may
            choose to cluster printers on a few given machines, or
            scatter them across an organization and possibly make
            extensive use of remote spoolers to make them globally
            available.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            how many machines will need a copy of the X Print Server
            configuration files.  The files have been architected so
            that one super-set version of them can be maintained and
            distributed (e.g.  via NFS), and a per-machine or per-user
            version of the `Xprinters' is all that is needed to have the
            appropriate information in them utilized or ignored.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            how many users can demand services from a given X Print

      With the above in mind, some obvious execution models include:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Global - in this model, the system administrator is choosing
            to run the X Print Service on a *few* select machines with
            appropriate printers configured, and allow clients access to
            the global resource.  This can centralize the administration
            of printers and configuration files, but may have to be
            monitored for performance loading.
          </para>
          <para>
            Startup would likely be done by boot-up scripts (such as <filename>/etc/init.d/xprint</filename>).

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Per-machine - every machine with potential X Print Service
            users would run the service.  Printer and configuration file
            administration is decentralized, and usage would be limited
            to the users on the machine.

            Service for themselves.  In the future, the Video X Server
            normally started may contain Print X Server capability, so
            this model becomes very natural.
          </para>
          <para>
            Startup would likely be done at session login or by
            launching actions or processes manually once the user
            logs in.  Note: Daemons like "dtpdmd" must be started after Xprt.

    <title>CLIENT CONFIGURATION</title>
    <para>
      Once a X Print Server and dtpdmd have been started -- many of them
      in some cases -- clients will need to find and use them.  There are
      two mechanisms that allow clients to discover X Print Servers and
      printers.

          <para>
            <programlisting>colorlj7@printhub:2</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
           In the above example, the X Print Server running at `printhub:2'
           is assumed to support the printer named `colorlj7'.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            <envar>${XPSERVERLIST}</envar> - assuming usage of the DtPrint print dialogs,
            the environment variable <envar>${XPSERVERLIST}</envar> can contain a list
            of X Print Servers.  For example:
          </para>
          <para>
            <programlisting>XPSERVERLIST="printhub:2 printhub:3 otherdept:0"</programlisting>
          </para>
          <para>
            Then in the dialogs, only a printer name needs to be entered.
            The dialog will then search the X Print Servers in <envar>${XPSERVERLIST}</envar>
            for a server than supports the printer, and then establish
            contact.

    <para>
      From most CDEnext applications, printing is accomplished by bringing
      down the &lt;File&gt; menu and selecting &lt;Print...&gt;.  This will result in
      the DtPrintSetupBox dialog, which will request the name of a printer,
      and offer limited capability to configure print options (e.g. number
      of copies).  If the user wishes, they can select &lt;Setup...&gt;, which
      will start a dtpdm capable of modifying additional print options.
      Finally, the user should select &lt;Print&gt;.

            This environment variable selects the locale settings used by the Xprint server.
            Xprt allows language-specific settings (stored in <filename>${XPCONFIGDIR}/${LANG}/print/</filename>)
            which will override the default settings (stored in <filename>${XPCONFIGDIR}/C/print/</filename>).
            If <envar>${LANG}</envar> is not set "C" is assumed.

	    <para>The environment variable <envar>${XPSERVERLIST}</envar> contains a list
	    of display identifiers (separated by whitespace) which tell an
	    application where it can find the Xprint servers.  Usually
	    <envar>${XPSERVERLIST}</envar> is set by the profile startup scripts (e.g.
	    <filename>/etc/profile</filename> or <filename>/etc/profile.d/xprint.sh</filename>) using the output of
	    <userinput>/etc/init.d/xprint get_xpserverlist</userinput>.</para>

	    <informalexample>
	      <programlisting>
		export XPSERVERLIST="littlecat:80 bitdog:72"</programlisting>
	    </informalexample>
	  <para>
