  <note><para>
This document describes software undergoing continual evolution, and
the interfaces described here are subject to change without notice.
This document is intended to cover the interfaces as found in the
xorg-server-&xserver.version; release, but is probably not completely
in sync with the code base.

    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>
This document was originally the design spec for the DDX layer of the
XFree86 4.0 X server.  The X.Org Foundation adopted the XFree86 4.4rc2
version of that server as the basis of the Xorg server project, and has
evolved the XFree86 DDX layer greatly since forking.   This document thus
covers only the current implementation of the XFree86 DDX as found in the
Xorg server &xserver.version; release, and no longer matches the XFree86
server itself.
      </para>

    <para>
The XFree86 Project's broad design principles for XFree86 4.0 were:

    <para>
While the XFree86 project had a goal of avoiding changes to the DIX
layer unless they found major deficiencies there, to avoid divergence from
the X.Org sample implementation they were integrating changes from, the
X.Org developers now maintain both sides, and make changes where they are
most appropriate.   This document concentrates on the XFree86 DDX layer used
in the Xorg server itself (the code found in <filename>hw/xfree86</filename>
in the source tree), and developers will also want to refer to the
<filename>Xserver-spec</filename> documentation that covers the DIX layer
routines common to all the X servers in the sample implementation.

    <title>The xorg.conf File</title>

    <para>
The xorg.conf file format is based on the XF86Config format from XFree86 4.4,
which is in turn similar to the old XFree86 3.x XF86Config format, with the
following changes:
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>&k.device; section</title>

      <para>
    The &k.device; sections are similar to what they used to be, and
    describe hardware-specific information for a single video card.
    &k.device;
    Some new keywords are added:


	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry><term>Driver "drivername"</term>
	    <listitem><para>
        Specifies the name of the driver to be used for the card.  This
        is mandatory.
	      </para></listitem></varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry><term>BusID "busslot"</term>
	    <listitem><para>
        Specifies uniquely the location of the card on the bus.  The
        purpose is to identify particular cards in a multi-headed
        configuration.  The format of the argument is intentionally
        vague, and may be architecture dependent.  For a PCI bus, it
        is something like "bus@domain:slot:func". The "@domain" part
        can be left out for domain 0.
	      </para></listitem></varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
      </para>

      <para>
    A &k.device; section is considered <quote>active</quote> if there is a reference
    to it in an active &k.screen; section.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>&k.screen; section</title>

      <para>
    The &k.screen; sections are similar to what they used to be.  They
    no longer have a &k.driver; keyword, but an &k.identifier; keyword
    is added.  (The &k.driver; keyword may be accepted in place of the
    &k.identifier; keyword for compatibility purposes.)  The identifier
    can be used to identify which screen is to be active when multiple
    &k.screen; sections are present.  It is possible to specify the active
    screen from the command line.  A default is chosen in the absence
    of one being specified.  A &k.screen; section is considered <quote>active</quote>
    if there is a reference to it either from the command line, or from
    an active &k.serverlayout; section.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>&k.inputdevice; section</title>

      <para>
    The &k.inputdevice; section is a new section that describes
    configuration information for input devices.  It replaces the old
    <emphasis>Keyboard</emphasis>, <emphasis>Pointer</emphasis> and <emphasis>XInput</emphasis>
    sections.  Like the &k.device; section, it has two mandatory keywords:
    &k.identifier; and &k.driver;.  For compatibility purposes the old
    <emphasis>Keyboard</emphasis> and <emphasis>Pointer</emphasis> sections are
    converted by the parser into &k.inputdevice; sections as follows:

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry><term><emphasis>Keyboard</emphasis></term>
	    <listitem><literallayout>
             &k.identifier; "Implicit Core Keyboard"
             &k.driver; "kbd"
	      </literallayout></listitem></varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry><term><emphasis>Pointer</emphasis></term>
	    <listitem><literallayout>
             &k.identifier; "Implicit Core Pointer"
             &k.driver; "mouse"
	      </literallayout></listitem></varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
      </para>

      <para>
    An &k.inputdevice; section is considered active if there is a
    reference to it in an active &k.serverlayout; section.  An
    &k.inputdevice; section may also be referenced implicitly if there
    is no &k.serverlayout; section, if the <option>-screen</option> command
    line options is used, or if the &k.serverlayout; section doesn't
    reference any &k.inputdevice; sections.  In this case, the first
    sections with drivers "kbd" and "mouse" are used as the core
    keyboard and pointer respectively.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>&k.serverlayout; section</title>

      <para>
    The &k.serverlayout; section is a new section that is used to identify
    which &k.screen; sections are to be used in a multi-headed configuration,
    and the relative layout of those screens.  It also identifies which
    &k.inputdevice; sections are to be used.  Each &k.serverlayout; section
    has an identifier, a list of &k.screen; section identifiers, and a list of
    &k.inputdevice; section identifiers.  &k.serverflags; options may also be
    included in a &k.serverlayout; section, making it possible to override
    the global values in the &k.serverflags; section.
      </para>

      <para>
    A &k.serverlayout; section can be made active by being referenced on
    the command line.  In the absence of this, a default will be chosen
    (the first one found).  The screen names may optionally be followed
    by a number specifying the preferred screen number, and optionally
    by information specifying the physical positioning of the screen,
    either in absolute terms or relative to another screen (or screens).
    When no screen number is specified, they are numbered according to
    the order in which they are listed.  The old (now obsolete) method
    of providing the positioning information is to give the names of
    the four adjacent screens.  The order of these is top, bottom, left,
    right.  Here is an example of a &k.serverlayout; section for two
    screens using the old method, with the second located to the right
    of the first:

	<programlisting>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1" ""  ""  ""  "Screen 2"
        Screen     1 "Screen 2"
        Screen     "Screen 3"
      EndSection
	</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
    The preferred way of specifying the layout is to explicitly specify
    the screen's location in absolute terms or relative to another
    screen.
      </para>

      <para>
    In the absolute case, the upper left corner's coordinates are given
    after the <emphasis>Absolute</emphasis> keyword.  If the coordinates are
    omitted, a value of <code>(0,0)</code> is assumed.  An example
    of absolute positioning follows:

	<programlisting>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1" Absolute 0 0
        Screen     1 "Screen 2" Absolute 1024 0
        Screen     "Screen 3" Absolute 2048 0
      EndSection
	</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
    In the relative case, the position is specified by either using one of
    the following keywords followed by the name of the reference screen:

	<simplelist type='vert' columns='1'>
	  <member><emphasis>RightOf</emphasis></member>
	  <member><emphasis>LeftOf</emphasis></member>
	  <member><emphasis>Above</emphasis></member>
	  <member><emphasis>Below</emphasis></member>
	  <member><emphasis>Relative</emphasis></member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>

      <para>
    When the <emphasis>Relative</emphasis> keyword is used, the reference screen
    name is followed by the coordinates of the new screen's origin
    relative to reference screen.  The following example shows how to use
    some of the relative positioning options.

	<programlisting>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1"
        Screen     1 "Screen 2" RightOf "Screen 1"
        Screen     "Screen 3" Relative "Screen 1" 2048 0
      EndSection
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Options</title>

      <para>
    Options are used more extensively.  They may appear in most sections
    now.  Options related to drivers can be present in the &k.screen;,
    &k.device; and &k.monitor; sections and the &k.display; subsections.
    The order of precedence is &k.display;, &k.screen;, &k.monitor;,
    &k.device;.  Options have been extended to allow an optional value
    to be specified in addition to the option name.  For more details
    about options, see the <link linkend="options">Options</link> section
    for details.
      </para>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Driver Interface</title>

    <para>
The driver interface consists of a minimal set of entry points that are
required based on the external events that the driver must react to.
No non-essential structure is imposed on the way they are used beyond
that.  This is a significant difference compared with the old design.
    </para>

    <para>
The entry points for drawing operations are already taken care of by
the framebuffer code.  Extensions and enhancements to framebuffer code
are outside the scope of this document.
    </para>

    <para>
This approach to the driver interface provides good flexibility, but does
increase the complexity of drivers.  To help address this, the XFree86
common layer provides a set of <quote>helper</quote> functions to take care of things
that most drivers need.  These helpers help minimise the amount of code
duplication between drivers.  The use of helper functions by drivers is
however optional, though encouraged.  The basic philosophy behind the
helper functions is that they should be useful to many drivers, that
they should balance this against the complexity of their interface.  It
is inevitable that some drivers may find some helpers unsuitable and
need to provide their own code.
    </para>

    <para>
Events that a driver needs to react to are:

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>ScreenInit</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     An initialisation function is called from the DIX layer for each
     screen at the start of each server generation.

	<varlistentry><term>Leave VT</term>

	  <listitem><para>

	<varlistentry><term>ViewPort change</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     Change the origin of the physical view port.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>ScreenSaver state change</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     Screen saver activation/deactivation.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>CloseScreen</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     A close screen function is called from the DIX layer for each screen
     at the end of each server generation.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </para>


    <para>
In addition to these events, the following functions are required by
the XFree86 common layer:

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>Identify</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     Print a driver identifying message.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>Probe</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     This is how a driver identifies if there is any hardware present that
     it knows how to drive.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>

	<varlistentry><term>PreInit</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     Process information from the xorg.conf file, determine the
     full characteristics of the hardware, and determine if a valid
     configuration is present.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
The VidMode extension also requires:

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>ValidMode</term>

	  <listitem><para>
     Identify if a new mode is usable with the current configuration.
     The PreInit function (and/or helpers it calls) may also make use
     of the ValidMode function or something similar.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </para>


    <para>
Other extensions may require other entry points.  The drivers will
inform the common layer of these in such cases.

    <title>Resource Access Control Introduction</title>

    <para>
Graphics devices are accessed through ranges in I/O or memory space.
While most modern graphics devices allow relocation of such ranges many
of them still require the use of well established interfaces such as
VGA memory and IO ranges or 8514/A IO ranges.  With modern buses (like
PCI) it is possible for multiple video devices to share access to these
resources.  The RAC (Resource Access Control) subsystem provides a
mechanism for this.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Terms and Definitions</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Bus</title>

	<para>
    <quote>Bus</quote> is ambiguous as it is used for different things: it may refer
    to physical incompatible extension connectors in a computer system.
    The RAC system knows two such systems: The ISA bus and the PCI bus.
    (On the software level EISA, MCA and VL buses are currently treated
    like ISA buses).  <quote>Bus</quote> may also refer to logically different
    entities on a single bus system which are connected via bridges.  A
    PCI system may have several distinct PCI buses connecting each other
    by PCI-PCI bridges or to the host CPU by HOST-PCI bridges.
	</para>

	<para>
    Systems that host more than one bus system link these together using
    bridges.  Bridges are a concern to RAC as they might block or pass
    specific resources.  PCI-PCI bridges may be set up to pass VGA
    resources to the secondary bus.  PCI-ISA buses pass any resources not
    decoded on the primary PCI bus to the ISA bus.  This way VGA resources
    (although exclusive on the ISA bus) can be shared by ISA and PCI
    cards.  Currently HOST-PCI bridges are not yet handled by RAC as they
    require specific drivers.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Entity</title>

	<para>
    The smallest independently addressable unit on a system bus is
    referred to as an entity.  So far we know ISA and PCI entities.  PCI
    entities can be located on the PCI bus by an unique ID consisting of
    the bus, card and function number.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Resource</title>

	<para>
    <quote>Resource</quote> refers to a range of memory or I/O addresses an entity
    can decode.
	</para>

	<para>
    If a device is capable of disabling this decoding the resource is
    called shareable.  For PCI devices a generic method is provided to
    control resource decoding.  Other devices will have to provide a
    device specific function to control decoding.
	</para>

	<para>
    If the entity is capable of decoding this range at a different
    location this resource is considered relocatable.
	</para>

	<para>
    Resources which start at a specific address and occupy a single
    continuous range are called block resources.
	</para>

	<para>
    Alternatively resource addresses can be decoded in a way that they
    satisfy the conditions:
	  <programlisting>
                    address &amp; mask == base
	  </programlisting>
    and
	  <programlisting>
                       base &amp; mask == base
	  </programlisting>
    Resources addressed in such a way are called sparse resources.
	</para>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Server States</title>

	<para>
    The resource access control system knows two server states: the
    SETUP and the OPERATING state.  The SETUP state is entered whenever
    a mode change takes place or the server exits or does VT switching.
    During this state all entity resources are under resource access
    control.  During OPERATING state only those entities are controlled
    which actually have shared resources that conflict with others.

  <sect1>
    <title>Control Flow in the Server and Mandatory Driver Functions</title>

    <para>
At the start of each server generation, <function>main()</function>
(<filename>dix/main.c</filename>) calls the DDX function
<function>InitOutput()</function>.  This is the first place that the DDX gets
control.  <function>InitOutput()</function> is expected to fill in the global
<structname>screenInfo</structname> struct, and one
<structfield>screenInfo.screen[]</structfield> entry for each screen present.
Here is what <function>InitOutput()</function> does:
    </para>

      <title>Parse the xorg.conf file</title>

      <para>
    This is done at the start of the first server generation only.
      </para>

      <para>
    The xorg.conf file is read in full, and the resulting information
    stored in data structures.  None of the parsed information is
    processed at this point.  The parser data structures are opaque to
    the video drivers and to most of the common layer code.
      </para>

      <para>
    The entire file is parsed first to remove any section ordering
    requirements.
      </para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2>
      <title>Initial processing of parsed information and command line options
      </title>

      <para>
    This is done at the start of the first server generation only.
      </para>

      <para>
    The initial processing is to determine paths like the
    <emphasis>ModulePath</emphasis>, etc, and to determine which &k.serverlayout;,
    &k.screen; and &k.device; sections are active.
      </para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2>
      <title>Enable port I/O access</title>

      <para>
    Port I/O access is controlled from the XFree86 common layer, and is
    <quote>all or nothing</quote>.  It is enabled prior to calling driver probes, at
    the start of subsequent server generations, and when VT switching
    back to the Xserver.  It is disabled at the end of server generations,
    and when VT switching away from the Xserver.
      </para>

      <para>
    The implementation details of this may vary on different platforms.
      </para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2>
      <title>General bus probe</title>

      <para>
    This is done at the start of the first server generation only.
      </para>

      <para>
    In the case of ix86 machines, this will be a general PCI probe.
    The full information obtained here will be available to the drivers.
    This information persists for the life of the Xserver.  In the PCI
    case, the PCI information for all video cards found is available by
    calling <function>xf86GetPciVideoInfo()</function>.
      </para>

      <blockquote><para>
	  <programlisting>
    pciVideoPtr *xf86GetPciVideoInfo(void);
	  </programlisting>
	  <blockquote><para>
	returns a pointer to a list of pointers to
	<structname>pciVideoRec</structname> entries, of which there is one for
	each detected PCI video card.  The list is terminated with a

	detected, the return value is <constant>NULL</constant>.

      <para>
    After the bus probe, the resource broker is initialised.

      <para>
    When a driver module is loaded, the loader calls its
    <function>Setup</function> function.  For video drivers, this function
    calls <function>xf86AddDriver()</function> to register the driver's
    <structname>DriverRec</structname>, which contains a small set of essential
    details and driver entry points required during the early phase of
    <function>InitOutput()</function>.  <function>xf86AddDriver()</function>
    adds it to the global <varname>xf86DriverList[]</varname> array.
      </para>

      <para>
    The <structname>DriverRec</structname> contains the driver canonical name,
    the <function>Identify()</function>,
    <function>Probe()</function> and <function>AvailableOptions()</function>
    function entry points as well as a pointer
    to the driver's module (as returned from the loader when the driver
    was loaded) and a reference count which keeps track of how many
    screens are using the driver.  The entry driver entry points are
    those required prior to the driver allocating and filling in its
    <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>.
      </para>

      <para>
    For a static server, the <varname>xf86DriverList[]</varname> array is
    initialised at build time, and the loading of modules is not done.
      </para>

      <para>
    A similar procedure is used for input drivers.  The input driver's
    <function>Setup</function> function calls
    <function>xf86AddInputDriver()</function> to register the driver's
    <structname>InputDriverRec</structname>, which contains a small set of
    essential details and driver entry points required during the early
    phase of <function>InitInput()</function>.
    <function>xf86AddInputDriver()</function> adds it to the global
    <varname>xf86InputDriverList[]</varname> array.  For a static server,
    the <varname>xf86InputDriverList[]</varname> array is initialised at
    build time.
      </para>

      <para>
    Both the <varname>xf86DriverList[]</varname> and

      <para>
    The Resource Access Control (RAC) subsystem is initialised before
    calling any driver functions that may access hardware.  All generic
    bus information is probed and saved (for restoration later).  All
    (shared resource) video devices are disabled at the generic bus
    level, and a probe is done to find the <quote>primary</quote> video device.  These
    devices remain disabled for the next step.

      The purpose of this is to identify all instances of hardware
      supported by the driver.  The flags value is currently either 0,
      <constant>PROBE_DEFAULT</constant> or <constant>PROBE_DETECT</constant>.
      <constant>PROBE_DETECT</constant> is used if "-configure" or "-probe"
      command line arguments are given and indicates to the
      <function>Probe()</function> function that it should not configure the
      bus entities and that no xorg.conf information is available.
	    </para>

	  <para>
      The probe must find the active device sections that match the
      driver by calling <function>xf86MatchDevice()</function>.  The number
      of matches found limits the maximum number of instances for this
      driver.  If no matches are found, the function should return
      <constant>FALSE</constant> immediately.
	  </para>

	<para>
      Devices that cannot be identified by using device-independent
      methods should be probed at this stage (keeping in mind that access
      to all resources that can be disabled in a device-independent way
      are disabled during this phase).  The probe must be a minimal
      probe.  It should just determine if there is a card present that
      the driver can drive.  It should use the least intrusive probe
      methods possible.  It must not do anything that is not essential,
      like probing for other details such as the amount of memory
      installed, etc.  It is recommended that the
      <function>xf86MatchPciInstances()</function> helper function be used
      for identifying matching PCI devices
      (see the <link linkend="rac">RAC</link> section).  These helpers also
      checks and claims the appropriate entity.  When not using the
      helper, that should be done with <function>xf86CheckPciSlot()</function>
      and <function>xf86ClaimPciSlot()</function> for PCI devices (see the
      <link linkend="rac">RAC</link> section).
	</para>

	<para>
      The probe must register all non-relocatable resources at this
      stage.  If a resource conflict is found between exclusive resources
      the driver will fail immediately.  This is usually best done with
      the <function>xf86ConfigPciEntity()</function> helper function
      for PCI.
        </para>

	<para>
      If a chipset is specified in an active device section which the
      driver considers relevant (ie it has no driver specified, or the
      driver specified matches the driver doing the probe), the Probe
      must return <constant>FALSE</constant> if the chipset doesn't match
      one supported by the driver.

      <function>xf86ConfigPciEntity()</function> for PCI instances.
      These functions allocate a <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> for active

      and the <function>xf86UnloadSubModule()</function> function should be used
      to do that.  Otherwise there is no need to explicitly unload modules

      <para>
    At this point, the valid screens are known.
    <function>AddScreen()</function> is called for each of them, passing
    <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> as the argument.
    <function>AddScreen()</function> is a DIX function that allocates a new
    <structfield>screenInfo.screen[]</structfield> entry (aka
    <varname>pScreen</varname>), and does some basic initialisation of it.
    It then calls the <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> function, with
    <parameter>pScreen</parameter> as one of its arguments.  If
    <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> returns <constant>FALSE</constant>,
    <function>AddScreen()</function> returns <constant>-1</constant>.  Otherwise
    it returns the index of the screen.  <function>AddScreen()</function>
    should only fail because of programming errors or failure to allocate
    resources (like memory).  All configuration problems should be
    detected BEFORE this point.

      Decide which operations need to be placed under resource access

      (<constant>RAC_VIEWPORT</constant>) and the colormap operations
      (<constant>RAC_COLORMAP</constant>).  Any operation that requires
      resources which might be disabled during OPERATING state should
      be set to use RAC.  This can be specified separately for memory

    The <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> function (or functions from other

    per-generation storage.  Since the <structname>ScreenRec</structname>'s

    <structfield>pScreen-&gt;CloseScreen</structfield> should be saved as part of
    the driver's per-screen private data, allowing it to be called from
    <function>ChipCloseScreen()</function>.  This means that the existing
    <function>CloseScreen()</function> function is wrapped.

      <title>Finalising RAC Initialisation</title>

      <para>
    After all the <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> functions have been
    called, each screen has registered its RAC requirements.  This
    information is used to determine which shared resources are requested
    by more than one driver and set the access functions accordingly.
    This is done following these rules:

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
	The shareable resources registered by each entity are compared.
	If a resource is registered by more than one entity the entity
	will be marked to indicate that it needs to share this resources
	type (IO or MEM).

	  <listitem><para>
	A resource marked <quote>unused</quote> will only conflict with an overlapping
	resource of an other entity if the second is actually in use
	during OPERATING state.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
	If an <quote>unused</quote> resource was found to conflict but the entity

	    <para>
      It should be noted that many chipsets impose restrictions on where the
      viewport may be placed in the virtual resolution, either for alignment
      reasons, or to prevent the start of the viewport from being positioned
      within a pixel (as can happen in a 24bpp mode).  After calculating the
      value the chipset's panning registers need to be set to for non-DGA
      modes, this function should recalculate the ScrnInfoRec's
      <structfield>frameX0</structfield>, <structfield>frameY0</structfield>, <structfield>frameX1</structfield>
      and <structfield>frameY1</structfield> fields to correspond to that value.  If
      this is not done, switching to another mode might cause the position
      of a hardware cursor to change.

      <title>Mode Validation</title>

      <para>
    When a mode validation helper supplied by the XFree86-common layer is
    being used, it can be useful to provide a function to check for hw
    specific mode constraints:
      </para>

      <blockquote><para>
	  <programlisting>
    ModeStatus ChipValidMode(ScrnInfoPtr pScrn, DisplayModePtr mode,

	  <blockquote><para>
      Check the passed mode for hw-specific constraints, and return the
      appropriate status value.

	    </para></blockquote>
	</para></blockquote>

      <para>
This function may also modify the effective timings and clock of the passed
mode.  These have been stored in the mode's <structfield>Crtc*</structfield> and
<structfield>SynthClock</structfield> elements, and have already been adjusted for
interlacing, doublescanning, multiscanning and clock multipliers and dividers.
The function should not modify any other mode field, unless it wants to modify
the mode timings reported to the user by <function>xf86PrintModes()</function>.
      </para>

      <para>
The function is called once for every mode in the xorg.conf Monitor section
assigned to the screen, with <parameter>flags</parameter> set to
<constant>MODECHECK_INITIAL</constant>.  It is subsequently called for every mode
in the xorg.conf Display subsection assigned to the screen, with
<parameter>flags</parameter> set to <constant>MODECHECK_FINAL</constant>.  In the second
case, the mode will have successfully passed all other tests.  In addition,
the <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>'s <structfield>virtualX</structfield>,
<structfield>virtualY</structfield> and <structfield>displayWidth</structfield> fields will have been
set as if the mode to be validated were to be the last mode accepted.
      </para>

      <para>
In effect, calls with MODECHECK_INITIAL are intended for checks that do not
depend on any mode other than the one being validated, while calls with
MODECHECK_FINAL are intended for checks that may involve more than one mode.

      <title>Data handling</title>

      <para>
Config file data contains parts that are global, and parts that are
Screen specific.  All of it is parsed into data structures that neither
the drivers or most other parts of the server need to know about.
      </para>

      <para>
The global data is typically not required by drivers, and as such, most
of it is stored in the private <structname>xf86InfoRec</structname>.
      </para>

      <para>
The screen-specific data collected from the config file is stored in
screen, device, display, monitor-specific data structures that are separate
from the <varname>ScrnInfoRecs</varname>, with the appropriate elements/fields
hooked into the <varname>ScrnInfoRecs</varname> as required.  The screen
config data is held in <structname>confScreenRec</structname>, device data in
the <structname>GDevRec</structname>, monitor data in the <structname>MonRec</structname>,
and display data in the <structname>DispRec</structname>.
      </para>

      <para>
The XFree86 common layer's screen specific data (the actual data in use
for each screen) is held in the <varname>ScrnInfoRecs</varname>.  As has
been outlined above, the <varname>ScrnInfoRecs</varname> are allocated at probe
time, and it is the responsibility of the Drivers' <function>Probe()</function>
and <function>PreInit()</function> functions to finish filling them in based
on both data provided on the command line and data provided from the
Config file.  The precedence for this is:

	<blockquote><para>
    command line  -&gt;  config file  -&gt;  probed/default data
	</para></blockquote>
      </para>

      <para>
For most things in this category there are helper functions that the
drivers can use to ensure that the above precedence is consistently
used.
      </para>

      <para>
As well as containing screen-specific data that the XFree86 common layer
(including essential parts of the server infrastructure as well as helper
functions) needs to access, it also contains some data that drivers use
internally.  When considering whether to add a new field to the
<structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>, consider the balance between the convenience
of things that lots of drivers need and the size/obscurity of the
<structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>.

Per-screen driver specific data that cannot be accommodated with the
static <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> fields is held in a driver-defined
data structure, a pointer to which is assigned to the
<structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>'s <structfield>driverPrivate</structfield> field.  This
is per-screen data that persists across server generations (as does the
bulk of the static <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> data).  It would typically
also include the video card's saved state.

Per-screen data for other modules that the driver uses that is reset for each

      <title>Allocating private data</title>

      <para>
A driver and any module it uses may allocate per-screen private storage
in either the <structname>ScreenRec</structname> (DIX level) or
<structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> (XFree86 common layer level).
<structname>ScreenRec</structname> storage persists only for a single server
generation, and <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> storage persists across
generations for the lifetime of the server.
      </para>

      <para>
The <structname>ScreenRec</structname> <structfield>devPrivates</structfield> data must be
reallocated/initialised at the start of each new generation.  This is
normally done from the <function>ChipScreenInit()</function> function, and
Init functions for other modules that it calls.  Data allocated in this
way should be freed by the driver's <function>ChipCloseScreen()</function>
functions, and Close functions for other modules that it calls.  A new
<structfield>devPrivates</structfield> entry is allocated by calling the
<function>AllocateScreenPrivateIndex()</function> function.
      </para>

      <blockquote><para>

    <title>Keeping Track of Bus Resources</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Theory of Operation</title>

      <para>
The XFree86 common layer has knowledge of generic access control mechanisms
for devices on certain bus systems (currently the PCI bus) as well as
of methods to enable or disable access to the buses itself.  Furthermore
it can access information on resources decoded by these devices and if
necessary modify it.
      </para>

      <para>
When first starting the Xserver collects all this information, saves it
for restoration, checks it for consistency, and if necessary, corrects
it.  Finally it disables all resources on a generic level prior to
calling any driver function.
      </para>

      <para>
When the <function>Probe()</function> function of each driver is called the
device sections are matched against the devices found in the system.
The driver may probe devices at this stage that cannot be identified by
using device independent methods.  Access to all resources that can be
controlled in a device independent way is disabled.  The
<function>Probe()</function> function should register all non-relocatable
resources at this stage.  If a resource conflict is found between
exclusive resources the driver will fail immediately.  Optionally the
driver might specify an <function>EntityInit()</function>,
<function>EntityLeave()</function> and <function>EntityEnter()</function> function.
      </para>

      <para>
<function>EntityInit()</function> can be used to disable any shared resources
that are not controlled by the generic access control functions.  It is
called prior to the PreInit phase regardless if an entity is active or
not.  When calling the <function>EntityInit()</function>,
<function>EntityEnter()</function> and <function>EntityLeave()</function> functions
the common level will disable access to all other entities on a generic
level.  Since the common level has no knowledge of device specific
methods to disable access to resources it cannot be guaranteed that
certain resources are not decoded by any other entity until the
<function>EntityInit()</function> or <function>EntityEnter()</function> phase is
finished.  Device drivers should therefore register all those resources
which they are going to disable.  If these resources are never to be
used by any driver function they may be flagged <constant>ResInit</constant>
so that they can be removed from the resource list after processing all
<function>EntityInit()</function> functions.  <function>EntityEnter()</function>
should disable decoding of all resources which are not registered as
exclusive and which are not handled by the generic access control in
the common level.  The difference to <function>EntityInit()</function> is
that the latter one is only called once during lifetime of the server.
It can therefore be used to set up variables prior to disabling resources.
<function>EntityLeave()</function> should restore the original state when
exiting the server or switching to a different VT.  It also needs to
disable device specific access functions if they need to be disabled on
server exit or VT switch.  The default state is to enable them before
giving up the VT.
      </para>

      <para>
In <function>PreInit()</function> phase each driver should check if any
shareable resources it has registered during <function>Probe()</function> has
been denied and take appropriate action which could simply be to fail.
If it needs to access resources it has disabled during
<function>EntitySetup()</function> it can do so provided it has registered
these and will disable them before returning from
<function>PreInit()</function>.  This also applies to all other driver
functions.  Several functions are provided to request resource ranges,
register these, correct PCI config space and add replacements for the
generic access functions.  Resources may be marked <quote>disabled</quote> or
<quote>unused</quote> during OPERATING stage.  Although these steps could also be
performed in <function>ScreenInit()</function>, this is not desirable.
      </para>

      <para>
Following <function>PreInit()</function> phase the common level determines
if resource access control is needed.  This is the case if more than
one screen is used.  If necessary the RAC wrapper module is loaded.  In
<function>ScreenInit()</function> the drivers can decide which operations
need to be placed under RAC.  Available are the frame buffer operations,
the pointer operations and the colormap operations.  Any operation that
requires resources which might be disabled during OPERATING state should
be set to use RAC.  This can be specified separately for memory and IO
resources.
      </para>

      <para>
When <function>ScreenInit()</function> phase is done the common level will
determine which shared resources are requested by more than one driver
and set the access functions accordingly.  This is done following these
rules:

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
   The shareable resources registered by each entity are compared.  If
   a resource is registered by more than one entity the entity will be
   marked to need to share this resources type (<constant>IO</constant> or
   <constant>MEM</constant>).
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
   A resource marked <quote>disabled</quote> during OPERATING state will be ignored
   entirely.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
   A resource marked <quote>unused</quote> will only conflicts with an overlapping
   resource of an other entity if the second is actually in use during
   OPERATING state.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
   If an <quote>unused</quote> resource was found to conflict however the entity
   does not use any other resource of this type the entire resource type
   will be disabled for that entity.
	    </para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
The driver has the choice among different ways to control access to
certain resources:

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
   It can rely on the generic access functions.  This is probably the
   most common case.  Here the driver only needs to register any resource
   it is going to use.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
   It can replace the generic access functions by driver specific
   ones.  This will mostly be used in cases where no generic access
   functions are available.  In this case the driver has to make sure
   these resources are disabled when entering the <function>PreInit()</function>
   stage.  Since the replacement functions are registered in
   <function>PreInit()</function> the driver will have to enable these
   resources itself if it needs to access them during this state.  The
   driver can specify if the replacement functions can control memory
   and/or I/O resources separately.
	    </para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para>
   The driver can enable resources itself when it needs them.  Each
   driver function enabling them needs to disable them before it will
   return.  This should be used if a resource which can be controlled
   in a device dependent way is only required during SETUP state.  This
   way it can be marked <quote>unused</quote> during OPERATING state.
	    </para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
A resource which is decoded during OPERATING state however never accessed
by the driver should be marked unused.
      </para>

      <para>
Since access switching latencies are an issue during Xserver operation,
the common level attempts to minimize the number of entities that need
to be placed under RAC control.  When a wrapped operation is called,
the <function>EnableAccess()</function> function is called before control is
passed on.  <function>EnableAccess()</function> checks if a screen is under
access control.  If not it just establishes bus routing and returns.
If the screen needs to be under access control,
<function>EnableAccess()</function> determines which resource types
(<literal remap="tt">MEM</literal>, <literal remap="tt">IO</literal>) are required.  Then it tests
if this access is already established.  If so it simply returns.  If
not it disables the currently established access, fixes bus routing and
enables access to all entities registered for this screen.
      </para>

      <para>
Whenever a mode switch or a VT-switch is performed the common level will
return to SETUP state.

Resource have certain properties.  When registering resources each range

There are two known access properties:

    for resources which may not be shared with any other device and

	  <listitem><para>
  <constant>ResShared</constant>
    for resources which can be disabled and therefore can be shared.
	    </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
If it is necessary to test a resource against any type a generic access
type <constant>ResAny</constant> is provided.  If this is set the resource
will conflict with any resource of a different entity intersecting its
range.  Further it can be specified that a resource is decoded however
never used during any stage (<constant>ResUnused</constant>) or during
OPERATING state (<constant>ResUnusedOpr</constant>).  A resource only visible
during the init functions (ie.  <function>EntityInit()</function>,
<function>EntityEnter()</function> and <function>EntityLeave()</function> should
be registered with the flag <constant>ResInit</constant>.  A resource that
might conflict with background resource ranges may be flagged with
<constant>ResBios</constant>.  This might be useful when registering resources
ranges that were assigned by the system Bios.

      The <parameter>PCIchipsets</parameter> list includes a list of the PCI

	<title>ScreenInit Phase</title>

	<para>
All that is required in this phase is to setup the RAC flags.  Note that
it is also permissible to set these flags up in the PreInit phase.  The
RAC flags are held in the <structfield>racIoFlags</structfield> and <structfield>racMemFlags</structfield> fields of the
<structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname> for each screen.  They specify which graphics operations
might require the use of shared resources.  This can be specified
separately for memory and I/O resources.  The available flags are defined
in <filename>rac/xf86RAC.h</filename>.  They are:

	  <variablelist>
	    <varlistentry><term><constant>RAC_FB</constant></term>
	      <listitem><para>
	for framebuffer operations (including hw acceleration)

  <sect1 id="options">
    <title>Config file <quote>Option</quote> entries</title>

    <para>
Option entries are permitted in most sections and subsections of the
config file.  There are two forms of option entries:

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term>Option "option-name"</term>
	  <listitem><para>
	A boolean option.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>
	<varlistentry><term>Option "option-name" "option-value"</term>
	  <listitem><para>
	An option with an arbitrary value.
	    </para></listitem></varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </para>

    <para>
The option entries are handled by the parser, and a list of the parsed
options is included with each of the appropriate data structures that
the drivers have access to.  The data structures used to hold the option
information are opaque to the driver, and a driver must not access the
option data directly.  Instead, the common layer provides a set of
functions that may be used to access, check and manipulate the option
data.
    </para>

    <para>
First, the low level option handling functions.  In most cases drivers
would not need to use these directly.

      <constant>OPTV_FREQ</constant> can be used for options values that are
      frequencies.  These values are a floating point number with an

    <title>Offscreen Memory Manager</title>

    <para>
Management of offscreen video memory may be handled by the XFree86
framebuffer manager.  Once the offscreen memory manager is running,
drivers or extensions may allocate, free or resize areas of offscreen
video memory using the following functions (definitions taken from
<filename>xf86fbman.h</filename>):

      <programlisting>
    typedef struct _FBArea {
        ScreenPtr    pScreen;
        BoxRec       box;
        int          granularity;
        void         (*MoveAreaCallback)(struct _FBArea*, struct _FBArea*)
        void         (*RemoveAreaCallback)(struct _FBArea*)
        DevUnion     devPrivate;
    } FBArea, *FBAreaPtr;

    typedef void (*MoveAreaCallbackProcPtr)(FBAreaPtr from, FBAreaPtr to)
    typedef void (*RemoveAreaCallbackProcPtr)(FBAreaPtr)

    FBAreaPtr xf86AllocateOffscreenArea (
        ScreenPtr pScreen,
        int width, int height,
        int granularity,
        MoveAreaCallbackProcPtr MoveAreaCallback,
        RemoveAreaCallbackProcPtr RemoveAreaCallback,
        pointer privData
    )

    void xf86FreeOffscreenArea (FBAreaPtr area)

    Bool xf86ResizeOffscreenArea (
	FBAreaPtr area
	int w, int h
    )
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
The function:
      <programlisting>
    Bool xf86FBManagerRunning(ScreenPtr pScreen);
      </programlisting>

can be used by an extension to check if the driver has initialized
the memory manager.  The manager is not available if this returns
<constant>FALSE</constant> and the functions above will all fail.
    </para>


    <para>
<function>xf86AllocateOffscreenArea()</function> can be used to request a
rectangle of dimensions <parameter>width</parameter>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<parameter>height</parameter>
(in pixels) from unused offscreen memory.  <parameter>granularity</parameter>
specifies that the leftmost edge of the rectangle must lie on some
multiple of <parameter>granularity</parameter> pixels.  A granularity of zero
means the same thing as a granularity of one - no alignment preference.
A <parameter>MoveAreaCallback</parameter> can be provided to notify the requester
when the offscreen area is moved.  If no <parameter>MoveAreaCallback</parameter>
is supplied then the area is considered to be immovable.  The
<parameter>privData</parameter> field will be stored in the manager's internal
structure for that allocated area and will be returned to the requester
in the <parameter>FBArea</parameter> passed via the
<parameter>MoveAreaCallback</parameter>.  An optional
<parameter>RemoveAreaCallback</parameter> is provided.  If the driver provides
this it indicates that the area should be allocated with a lower priority.
Such an area may be removed when a higher priority request (one that
doesn't have a <parameter>RemoveAreaCallback</parameter>) is made.  When this
function is called, the driver will have an opportunity to do whatever
cleanup it needs to do to deal with the loss of the area, but it must
finish its cleanup before the function exits since the offscreen memory
manager will free the area immediately after.
    </para>

    <para>
<function>xf86AllocateOffscreenArea()</function> returns <constant>NULL</constant>
if it was unable to allocate the requested area.  When no longer needed,
areas should be freed with <function>xf86FreeOffscreenArea()</function>.
    </para>

    <para>
<function>xf86ResizeOffscreenArea()</function> resizes an existing
<literal remap="tt">FBArea</literal>.  <function>xf86ResizeOffscreenArea()</function>
returns <constant>TRUE</constant> if the resize was successful.  If
<function>xf86ResizeOffscreenArea()</function> returns <constant>FALSE</constant>,
the original <literal remap="tt">FBArea</literal> is left unmodified.  Resizing an
area maintains the area's original <literal remap="tt">granularity</literal>,
<literal remap="tt">devPrivate</literal>, and <literal remap="tt">MoveAreaCallback</literal>.
<function>xf86ResizeOffscreenArea()</function> has considerably less overhead
than freeing the old area then reallocating the new size, so it should
be used whenever possible.

is provided to query the width and height of the largest single
<structname>FBArea</structname> allocatable given a particular priority.

is provided as an extreme method to free up offscreen memory.  This
will remove all removable <structname>FBArea</structname> allocations.

Initialization of the XFree86 framebuffer manager is done via

    Bool xf86InitFBManager(ScreenPtr pScreen, BoxPtr FullBox);

<parameter>FullBox</parameter> represents the area of the framebuffer that the
manager is allowed to manage.  This is typically a box with a width of
<structfield>pScrn-&gt;displayWidth</structfield> and a height of as many lines as
can be fit within the total video memory, however, the driver can reserve
areas at the extremities by passing a smaller area to the manager.

    <title>Colormap Handling</title>

    <para>
A generic colormap handling layer is provided within the XFree86 common

a function from the driver that loads the hardware palette when required.
To use the colormap layer, a driver calls the
<function>xf86HandleColormaps()</function> function.

      <parameter>maxColors</parameter> is the number of entries in the palette.

      component in the DAC's palette.  <parameter>loadPalette</parameter>
      is a driver-provided function for loading a colormap into the
      hardware, and is described below.  <parameter>setOverscan</parameter> is
      an optional function that may be provided when the overscan color

    <title>The XFree86 X Video Extension (Xv) Device Dependent Layer</title>

    <para>
XFree86 offers the X Video Extension which allows clients to treat video
as any another primitive and <quote>Put</quote> video into drawables.  By default,
the extension reports no video adaptors as being available since the
DDX layer has not been initialized.  The driver can initialize the DDX
layer by filling out one or more <literal remap="tt">XF86VideoAdaptorRecs</literal>
as described later in this document and passing a list of
<literal remap="tt">XF86VideoAdaptorPtr</literal> pointers to the following function:

      <programlisting>
    Bool xf86XVScreenInit(ScreenPtr pScreen,
                          XF86VideoAdaptorPtr *adaptPtrs,
                          int num);
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
After doing this, the extension will report video adaptors as being
available, providing the data in their respective
<literal remap="tt">XF86VideoAdaptorRecs</literal> was valid.
<function>xf86XVScreenInit()</function> <emphasis>copies</emphasis> data from the structure
passed to it so the driver may free it after the initialization.  At
the moment, the DDX only supports rendering into Window drawables.
Pixmap rendering will be supported after a sufficient survey of suitable
hardware is completed.

    <title>The Loader</title>

    <para>
This section describes the interfaces to the module loader.  The loader
interfaces can be divided into two groups: those that are only available to
the XFree86 common layer, and those that are also available to modules.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Loader Overview</title>

      <para>
The loader is capable of loading modules in a range of object formats,
and knowledge of these formats is built in to the loader.  Knowledge of
new object formats can be added to the loader in a straightforward
manner.  This makes it possible to provide OS-independent modules (for
a given CPU architecture type).  In addition to this, the loader can
load modules via the OS-provided <function>dlopen(3)</function> service where
available.  Such modules are not platform independent, and the semantics
of <function>dlopen()</function> on most systems results in significant
limitations in the use of modules of this type.  Support for
<function>dlopen()</function> modules in the loader is primarily for
experimental and development purposes.
      </para>

      <para>
Symbols exported by the loader (on behalf of the core X server) to
modules are determined at compile time.  Only those symbols explicitly
exported are available to modules.  All external symbols of loaded
modules are exported to other modules, and to the core X server.  The
loader can be requested to check for unresolved symbols at any time,
and the action to be taken for unresolved symbols can be controlled by
the caller of the loader.  Typically the caller identifies which symbols
can safely remain unresolved and which cannot.
      </para>

      <para>
NOTE:  Now that ISO-C allows pointers to functions and pointers to data to
have different internal representations, some of the following interfaces
will need to be revisited.

The module version information, and the optional <function>SetupProc</function>
and <function>TearDownProc</function> entry points are found by the loader
by locating a data object in the module called "modnameModuleData",
where "modname" is the canonical name of the module.  Modules must
contain such a data object, and it must be declared with global scope,
be compile-time initialised, and is of the following type:

	<programlisting>
typedef struct {
    XF86ModuleVersionInfo *     vers;
    ModuleSetupProc             setup;
    ModuleTearDownProc          teardown;

	</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
The vers parameter must be initialised to a pointer to a correctly
initialised <structname>XF86ModuleVersionInfo</structname> struct.  The other
two parameter are optional, and should be initialised to
<constant>NULL</constant> when not required.  The other parameters are defined
as

	    <para>
      The first stage of this function checks that the
      <parameter>virtualX</parameter> and <parameter>virtualY</parameter> values
      supplied (if greater than zero) are consistent with the line pitch
      and <parameter>maxHeight</parameter> limitations.  If not, an error
      message is printed, and the return value is <constant>-1</constant>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
      The second stage sets up the mode pool, eliminating immediately
      any modes that exceed the driver's line pitch limits, and also
      the virtual width and height limits (if greater than zero).  For
      each mode removed an informational message is printed at verbosity
      level <constant>2</constant>.  If the mode pool ends up being empty,
      a warning message is printed, and the return value is
      <constant>0</constant>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
      The final stage is to lookup each mode name, and fill in the remaining
      parameters.  If an error condition is encountered, a message is
      printed, and the return value is <constant>-1</constant>.  Otherwise,
      the return value is the number of valid modes found
      (<constant>0</constant> if none are found).
	    </para>

	    <para>
      Even if the supplied mode names include duplicates, no two names will
      ever match the same mode.  Furthermore, if the supplied mode names do not
      yield a valid mode (including the case where no names are passed at all),
      the function will continue looking through the mode pool until it finds
      a mode that survives all checks, or until the mode pool is exhausted.

	    <para>
      A message is only printed by this function when a fundamental

      <title>VGA Register Access Functions</title>

    The vgahw module abstracts access to the standard VGA registers by
    using a set of functions held in the <structname>vgaHWRec</structname>.  When
    the <structname>vgaHWRec</structname> is created these function pointers are
    initialised with the set of standard VGA I/O register access functions.
    In addition to these, the vgahw module includes a basic set of MMIO
    register access functions, and the <structname>vgaHWRec</structname> function
    pointers can be initialised to these by calling the
    <function>vgaHWSetMmioFuncs()</function> function described above.  Some
    drivers/platforms may require a different set of functions for VGA
    access.  The access functions are described here.

    <title>Some notes about writing a driver</title>

    <note><para>NOTE: some parts of this are not up to date</para></note>

    <para>
The following is an outline for writing a basic unaccelerated driver
for a PCI video card with a linear mapped framebuffer, and which has a
VGA core.  It is includes some general information that is relevant to
most drivers (even those which don't fit that basic description).
    </para>

    <para>
The information here is based on the initial conversion of the Matrox
Millennium driver to the <quote>new design</quote>.  For a fleshing out and sample
implementation of some of the bits outlined here, refer to that driver.
Note that this is an example only.  The approach used here will not be
appropriate for all drivers.
    </para>

    <para>
Each driver must reserve a unique driver name, and a string that is used
to prefix all of its externally visible symbols.  This is to avoid name
space clashes when loading multiple drivers.  The examples here are for
the <quote>ZZZ</quote> driver, which uses the <quote>ZZZ</quote> or <quote>zzz</quote> prefix for its externally
visible symbols.
    </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Include files</title>

      <para>
  All drivers normally include the following headers:
	<literallayout><filename>
    "xf86.h"
    "xf86_OSproc.h"
    "xf86_ansic.h"
    "xf86Resources.h"
	  </filename></literallayout>
  Wherever inb/outb (and related things) are used the following should be
  included:
	<literallayout><filename>
    "compiler.h"
	  </filename></literallayout>
  Note: in drivers, this must be included after <filename>"xf86_ansic.h"</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
  Drivers that need to access PCI vendor/device definitions need this:
	<literallayout><filename>

    A function is usually required to allocate the driver's

    The <structname>ScrnInfoRec</structname>'s <structfield>driverPrivate</structfield> is

    it is zeroed, and if the allocation fails the server exits.

    When allocating structures from inside the driver which are defined
