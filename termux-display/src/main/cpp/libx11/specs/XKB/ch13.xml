<title>Keyboard Geometry</title>

<para>
The Xkb description of a keyboard includes an optional keyboard geometry that
describes the physical appearance of the keyboard. Keyboard geometry describes
the shape, location, and color of all keyboard keys or other visible keyboard
components such as indicators. The information contained in a keyboard geometry
is sufficient to allow a client program to draw an accurate two-dimensional
image of the keyboard.
</para>


<para>
You can retrieve a keyboard geometry from an X server that supports Xkb, or you
can allocate it from scratch and initialize it in a client program. The
keyboard geometry need not have any correspondence with the physical keyboard
that is connected to the X server.
</para>


<para>
Geometry measurements are specified in mm/10 units. The origin (0,0) is in the
top left corner of the keyboard image. A component’s own origin is also its
upper left corner. In some cases a component needs to be drawn rotated. For
example, a special keyboard may have a section of keys arranged in rows in a
rectangular area, but the entire rectangle may not be in alignment with the
rest of the keyboard, and instead, it is rotated from horizontal by 30°.
Rotation for a geometry object is specified in 1/10° increments about its
origin. An example of a keyboard with rotated sections is shown in <link linkend="figure13.1">Figure 13.1</link>.

<para>
Some geometry components include a
<structfield>priority</structfield>,
which indicates the order in which overlapping objects should be drawn.
Objects should be drawn in order from highest priority (0) to lowest (255).

The keyboard geometry’s top-level description is stored in a
<structname>XkbGeometryRec</structname>
structure. This structure contains three types of information:
</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Lists of items, not used to draw the basic keyboard, but indexed by the
geometry descriptions that comprise the entire keyboard geometry (colors,
geometry properties, key aliases, shapes)
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
A number of singleton items that describe the keyboard as a whole (keyboard
name, width and height, a color for the keyboard as a whole, and a color for
keyboard key labels)
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
A list of the keyboard’s sections and nonkey doodads
    </para>
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
The top-level geometry is described in more detail in the following.
</para>


<para>
The lists of items used by components of the keyboard geometry description is
as follows:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
The top-level keyboard geometry description includes a list of up to
<symbol>XkbGeomMaxColors</symbol>
(32)
<firstterm>color names</firstterm>.
A color name is a string whose interpretation is not specified by Xkb. The
<structname>XkbColorRec</structname>
structure provides a field for this name as well as a pixel field. The pixel
field is a convenient place for an application to store a pixel value or color
definition, if it needs to. All other geometry data structures refer to colors
using their indices in this global list.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The top-level keyboard geometry description includes a list of
<firstterm>geometry properties</firstterm>.
A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary
name. Geometry properties can be used to provide hints to programs that display
images of keyboards, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry
structures refer to geometry properties. As an example of a possible use of
<structfield>properties</structfield>,
consider the pause/break key on most PC keyboards: the <quote>break</quote>
symbol is
usually on the front of the key and is often a different color. A program might
set a property to:
  </para>
  <para>
LBL_PAUS = "{Pause/top/black,Break/front/red}"
  </para>
  <para>
and use the property information to draw the key with a front label as well as
a top label.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The top-level keyboard geometry description includes a list of
<firstterm>key aliases</firstterm>
(see <xref linkend="Symbolic_Names" />). Key aliases allow the keyboard layout designer to assign
multiple key names to a single key.
  </para>
<note><para>Key aliases defined in the geometry component of a keyboard mapping
override those defined in the keycodes component of the server database, which
are stored in the
<structname>XkbNamesRec</structname>

(<structfield>xkb-&gt;names</structfield>).
Therefore, consider the key aliases defined by the geometry before
considering key aliases supplied by the keycodes.</para></note>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The top-level keyboard geometry description includes a list of
<structfield>shapes</structfield>;
other keyboard components refer to shapes by their index in this list. A
shape consists of an arbitrary name of type Atom and one or more closed-polygon
<structfield>outlines</structfield>.
All points in an outline are specified relative to the origin of its
enclosing shape, that is, whichever shape that contains this outline in its
list of outlines. One outline is the primary outline. The primary outline is by
default the first outline, or it can be optionally specified by the
<structfield>primary</structfield>
field in the
<structname>XkbShapeRec</structname>
structure. A keyboard display application can generate a simpler but still
accurate keyboard image by displaying only the primary outlines for each shape.
Nonrectangular keys must include a rectangular
<firstterm>approximation</firstterm>
as one of the outlines associated with the shape. The approximation is not
normally displayed but can be used by very simple keyboard display applications
to generate a recognizable but degraded image of the keyboard.
  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The
<structname>XkbGeometryRec</structname>
top-level geometry description contains the following information that
pertains to the keyboard as a whole:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
A
<firstterm>keyboard symbolic name</firstterm>
of type Atom to help users identify the keyboard.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The
<structfield>width</structfield>
and
<structfield>height</structfield>
of the keyboard, in mm/10. For nonrectangular keyboards, the width and height
describe the smallest bounding box that encloses the outline of the keyboard.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The
<firstterm>base color</firstterm>
of the keyboard is the predominant color on the keyboard and is used as the
default color for any components whose color is not explicitly specified.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The
<firstterm>label color</firstterm>
is the color used to draw the labels on most of the keyboard keys.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
The
<firstterm>label font</firstterm>
is a string that describes the font used to draw labels on most keys; label
fonts are arbitrary strings, because Xkb does not specify the format or name
space for font names.
  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The keyboard is subdivided into named
<structfield>sections</structfield>
of related keys and doodads. The sections and doodads on the keyboard are
listed in the
<structname>XkbGeometryRec</structname>
top-level keyboard geometry description. A section is composed of keys that
are physically together and logically related. <link linkend="figure13.2">Figure 13.2</link> shows a keyboard
that is divided into four sections. A
<structfield>doodad</structfield>
describes some visible aspect of the keyboard that is not a key and is not a
section.

used to draw keyboard components and stored in a
<structname>XkbShapeRec</structname>
structure, has:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
An arbitrary name of type Atom.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
Bounds (two x and y coordinates) that describe the corners of a rectangle

  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
Optional pointers to a primary and an approximation outline (described below).
If either of these pointers is
<symbol>NULL</symbol>,
the default primary/approximation outline is the first one in the list of
outlines for the shape.
  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
An
<firstterm>outline</firstterm>,
stored in a
<structname>XkbOutlineRec</structname>
structure, is a list of one or more points that describes a single
closed-polygon, as follows:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
A list with a single point describes a rectangle with one corner at the origin
of the shape (0,0) and the opposite corner at the specified point.
  </para>

A list of two points describes a rectangle with one corner at the position
specified by the first point and the opposite corner at the position specified
by the second point.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
A list of three or more points describes an arbitrary polygon. If necessary,
the polygon is automatically closed by connecting the last point in the list
with the first.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
A nonzero value for the
<structfield>corner_radius</structfield>
field specifies that the corners of the polygon should be drawn as circles
with the specified radius.
  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
All points in an outline are specified relative to the origin of the enclosing
shape. Points in an outline may have negative values for the X and Y coordinate.
</para>


<para>
One outline is the primary outline; a keyboard display application can generate
a simple but still accurate keyboard image by displaying only the primary
outlines for each shape. The default primary outline is the first in a
shape’s list of outlines. If the
<structfield>primary</structfield>
field of the
<structname>XkbShapeRec</structname>
structure is not
<symbol>NULL</symbol>,
it points to the primary outline. A rectangular
<firstterm>approximation</firstterm>
must be included for nonrectangular keys as one of the outlines associated
with the shape; the approximation is not normally displayed but can be used by
very simple keyboard display applications to generate a recognizable but
degraded image of the keyboard.
</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id='Sections'>
<title>Sections</title>

<para>
As previously noted, a keyboard is subdivided into
<structfield>sections</structfield>
of related keys. Each section has its own coordinate system — if a section
is rotated, the coordinates of any components within the section are
interpreted relative to the edges that were on the top and left before
rotation. The components that make up a section, stored in a
<structname>XkbSectionRec</structname>,
include:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
An arbitrary name of type Atom.

A row is a list of horizontally or vertically adjacent keys. Horizontal rows
parallel the (prerotation) top of the section, and vertical rows parallel the
(prerotation) left of the section. All keys in a horizontal row share a common
top coordinate; all keys in a vertical row share a left coordinate. <link linkend="figure13.3">Figure 13.3</link>

<title>Rows and Keys</title>

<para>
A row description
(<structname>XkbRowRec</structname>)
consists of the coordinates of its origin relative to its enclosing section,
a flag indicating whether the row is horizontal or vertical, and a list of keys
in the row.
</para>


<para>
A key description
(<structname>XkbKeyRec</structname>)
consists of a key name, a shape, a key color, and a gap. The key name should
correspond to one of the keys named in the keyboard names description, the
shape specifies the appearance of the key, and the key color specifies the
color of the key (not the label on the key; the label color is stored in the
<structname>XkbGeometryRec</structname>).
Keys are normally drawn immediately adjacent to one another from left to
right (or top to bottom) within a row. The gap field specifies the distance
between a key and its predecessor.
</para>


</sect1>
<sect1 id='Doodads'>
<title>Doodads</title>

<para>
Doodads can be global to the keyboard or part of a section. Doodads have
symbolic names of arbitrary length. The only doodad name whose interpretation
is specified by Xkb is <quote>Edges</quote>, which, if present, describes the
outline of the entire keyboard.
</para>


<para>
Each doodad’s origin is stored in fields named
<structfield>left</structfield>
and
<structfield>top</structfield>,
which are the coordinates of the doodad’s origin relative to its enclosing
object, whether it be a section or the top-level keyboard. The priority for
doodads that are listed in the top-level geometry is relative to the other
doodads listed in the top-level geometry and the sections listed in the
top-level geometry. The priority for doodads listed in a section are relative
to the other components of the section. Each doodad is stored in a structure
with a
<structfield>type</structfield>
field, which specifies the type of doodad.
</para>

<para>
Xkb supports five types of doodads:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
  <para>
An
<firstterm>indicator doodad</firstterm>
describes one of the physical keyboard indicators. Indicator doodads specify
the shape of the indicator, the indicator color when it is lit
(<emphasis>on_color</emphasis>)
and the indicator color when it is dark
(<emphasis>off_color</emphasis>).

  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
An
<firstterm>outline doodad</firstterm>
describes some aspect of the keyboard to be drawn as one or more hollow,
closed polygons. Outline doodads specify the shape, color, and angle of
rotation about the doodad origin at which they should be drawn.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
A
<firstterm>solid doodad</firstterm>
describes some aspect of the keyboard to be drawn as one or more filled
polygons. Solid doodads specify the shape, color, and angle of rotation about
the doodad origin at which they should be drawn.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
A
<firstterm>text doodad</firstterm>
describes a text label somewhere on the keyboard. Text doodads specify the
label string, the font and color to use when drawing the label, and the angle
of rotation of the doodad about its origin.
  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para>
A
<firstterm>logo doodad</firstterm>
is a catch-all, which describes some other visible element of the keyboard. A
logo doodad is essentially an outline doodad with an additional symbolic name
that describes the element to be drawn. If a keyboard display program
recognizes the symbolic name, it can draw something appropriate within the
bounding region of the shape specified in the doodad. If the symbolic name does
not describe a recognizable image, it should draw an outline using the
specified shape, outline, and angle of rotation. The Xkb extension does not
specify the interpretation of logo names.

However, if a keyboard description has been previously loaded, you can

Xkb provides a number of convenience functions to help use a keyboard geometry.
These include functions to return the bounding box of a shape’s top surface
and to update the bounding box of a shape row or section.
</para>

A shape is made up of a number of outlines. Each outline is a polygon made up
of a number of points. The bounding box of a shape is a rectangle that contains
all the outlines of that shape.

<title>Adding Elements to a Keyboard Geometry</title>

<para>
Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard
geometry. In each case the
<structfield>num_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do
not change
<structfield>sz_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the
values of the element’s structure from the arguments. For other functions,
you must explicitly write code to fill the structure’s elements.
</para>


<para>
The top-level geometry description includes a list of
<firstterm>geometry properties</firstterm>.
A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary
name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties as
hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer
to geometry properties.

<para>
Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a
keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries.
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new element(s), and it
is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation
functions increase
<structfield>sz_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
but never touch
<structfield>num_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
(unless there is an allocation failure, in which case they reset both
<structfield>sz_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
and
<structfield>num_<replaceable>*</replaceable></structfield>
to zero). These functions return
<symbol>Success</symbol>
if they succeed,
<errorname>BadAlloc</errorname>
if they are not able to allocate space, or
<errorname>BadValue</errorname>
if a parameter is not as expected.
