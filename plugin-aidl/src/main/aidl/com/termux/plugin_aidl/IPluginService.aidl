/**
* All available methods in {@link com.termux.app.plugin.PluginService}.
* When modifying methods here, use the following scheme to maintain backwards compatibility:
* <ul>
* <li>Append the version code of the last app version where the method exists with the current method signature as a postfix to the method you want to modify.</li>
* <li>Also rename the method in {@link com.termux.app.plugin.PluginService.PluginServiceBinder}.</li>
* <li>create a method with the original name, a new transaction id and the updated method signature.
* You should always count the transaction id up from the last created method to prevent clashing with old methods.</li>
* </ul>
* The old implementation should be kept for backwards compatibility, at least for some time.<br>
* Example:<br>
* Version code of the last app release: 118<br>
* Method: String foo(String bar) = 33;<br>
* Renamed: String foo_118(String bar) = 33;<br>
* New method: boolean foo(String bar) = 34;<br><br>
